Mentor: Abhishek Shrivastava, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITK

- Performed extensive EDA including monovariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to uncover patterns and feature rele-
vance in Student Health and Attendance and 3D printing datasets.

– Applied data preprocessing techniques such as outlier removal, categorical encoding, missing value imputation, and feature
scaling (MinMax & StandardScaler).

– Developed and evaluated multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, LGBM) using LazyPre-
dict and custom hyperparameter optimization.

– Utilized heatmap-based correlation analysis for thresholding and feature selection; validated models using accuracy, F1-score,
and ROC-AUC.
